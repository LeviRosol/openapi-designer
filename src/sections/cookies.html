      <h3>What are Website cookies</h3>
      <p>
A cookie is a small file which asks permission to be placed on users computerâ€™s hard drive. Once users agree, the file is added and the cookie helps analyze web traffic or lets users know when they visit a particular site. Cookies allow web applications to respond to user as an individual. The web application can tailor its operations to your needs, likes and dislikes by gathering and remembering information about users preferences.

      <p>
The Controller uses traffic log cookies to identify which pages are being used. This helps the Controller analyze data about webpage traffic and improve the website in order to tailor it to customer needs. The Controller only uses this information for statistical analysis purposes and then the data is removed from the system.
