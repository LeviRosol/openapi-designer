      <h3>What is OpenAPI designer?</h3>
      <p>
        OpenAPI designer allows you to create and edit API design files.
        It is a a form based editor for designing APIs.
        It currently supports the <a href="http://swagger.io/">OpenAPI/Swagger</a> version 2.0.
      </p>

      <h3>Why use OpenAPI designer?</h3>
      <p>
        Developers can get started more easily if they can view an API design document and can try out the API calls.
        API designers can share the design file and get feedback from other stakeholders. This facilitates collaborative API design process.
      </p>
      <p>
        Coding skills and understanding of JSON/YAML is not required for using the OpenAPI designer.
        The UI guides the user through the process of creating the required information.
      </p>

      <h3>How to use it?</h3>
      <p>
        When the editor is opened for the first time, there is an empty form. The design file can be created by adding paths, types, operations and parameters.
        Types, Parameters, Operations and Tags can be designed globally and referred to under Paths.
        You can download the designed file as JSON or YAML.
        The downloaded file can be viewed in viewers such as <a href="http://swagger.io/swagger-ui/">Swagger UI</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        OpenAPI designer supports saving files to OpenAPI space and locally to browser caches.
        Local saving is automatic and happens each time you edit something.
        You can upload the document to OpenAPI space using the cloud button in the top right corner.
      </p>
      <p>
        Future enhancements include OpenAPI <a href="https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/OpenAPI.next/README.md">version 3.0</a> support
        and adding helpful info texts to help users create API documentations without knowing the OpenAPI spec.
